# Github-User-Search-with-API














<h1>Hi Iâ€™m Selman ðŸ‘‹. Welcome to my  Github User Search App  </h1>

<br>

<p>In this project, I made an app that pulls the github users' data from https://api.github.com/, searches for users and displays the user picture, the number of followers, the number of following and the number of repos as card components.  </p>
